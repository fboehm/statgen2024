## Overview

We used five MR methods when analyzing FMD as a putative cause of CKD.

1. Inverse Variance Weighted
1. Weighted Median
1. MR Egger
1. Simple Mode
1. Weighted Mode



For a valid instrumental variable (SNP), the SNP-outcome association is the product of the SNP-exposure association and the causal effect of exposure on outcome.

$$\Gamma = \beta\gamma$$

Where $\Gamma$ is the SNP-outcome association, $\beta$ is the SNP-exposure association, and $\gamma$ is the causal effect of exposure on outcome.

$$\hat\beta = \frac{\Gamma}{\gamma}$$
